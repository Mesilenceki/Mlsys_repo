# Mlsys_repo
## A paper list about machine learning system and infrastructure published after TensorFlow. (will be updated)

The papers are mainly from system conferences, including OSDI, SOSP, NSDI, EUROSYS, ATC, SoCC. As machine learning system/infrastructure is a cross-domain research area, some research papers might publish in ASPLOS, ISCA, NeuralPS… This paper list focuses on system design for machine learning. The hardware design and algorithm design papers are excluded.
